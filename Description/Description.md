# Description: TrafficPulse

## Static Part
Our idea is to dig into the technology of website analysis. We will explain how reading informations from a website works, which are not visible to the 'normal' eye. Website owners and those interested in learning will use our website, as it helps them understand and optimize the technology. At the end of the page is the wireframe diagram for the website.

We will explain following Words in Detail on our static part:
- Conversion Rate
- SEO/SEA
- Geotargeting
- Traffic Source Analytics
- Click through Analytics
- Scroll Tracking

Also we will tell you what you can do to improve your Website. This will be found under the section: 

## Dynamic Part
We will build a website where users can enter a website domain and then receive information about the website. For example, the HTTP status code or website traffic will be measured and presented. We may also use diagrams to provide users with a visual representation of the information.
