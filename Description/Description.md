# Description: TrafficPulse

## Static Part
Our idea is to dig into the technology of website analysis. We will explain how reading informations from a website works, which are not visible to the 'normal' eye. Website owners and those interested in learning will use our website, as it helps them understand and optimize the technology. At the end of the page is the wireframe diagram for the website.

We will explain following Words in Detail on our static part:
- Conversion Rate
- SEO/SEA
- Geotargeting
- Traffic Source Analytics
- Click through Analytics
- Scroll Tracking

Also we will tell you what you can do to improve your Website. This will be found under the section: 

## Dynamic Part
We plan to enhance each individual bullet point in the static section with dynamic elements. As an illustration, for the Scroll Tracking feature, we will incorporate a scrolling analysis. Upon reaching the end of the site, you'll be able to discern where you spent the majority of your time and identify which elements you chose to skip.
