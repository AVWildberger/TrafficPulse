What Is Geotargeting and Why It`s an Important Advertising Strategy?

Geotargeting works by detecting users' locations using tools like GPS or cell towers. Geotargeting apps, such as Deliveroo or Just Eat, use real-time 
location data to customize listings for a better consumer experience. Google employs geotargeting in search results, organizing them based on the user's location. 
Geotargeting software enables reaching the target audience by allowing advertising to access different datasets and targeting tools. Three examples are:

Audience Targeting:
Identify key demographics based on core behaviors. For instance, create targeted online ads for people who visited a specific brand, category, or location within a fixed period. 
Understand customer behavior to make data-driven marketing decisions.

Location Targeting:
Gain insight into consumer behavior and movement in specific regions. On-site mobile location targeting provides real-time insight into customers' whereabouts, allowing tailored messaging. 
Observe collective behaviors in neighborhoods to develop viable promotions.

Weather Targeting:
Adapt messaging to real-time conditions, effective in out-of-home (OOH) advertising. Interactive displays can be adjusted based on weather shifts to optimize messaging and drive increased brand interaction.
Display OOH messaging at specific times to target customers when they're most likely to engage.
