Click-Through Rate (CTR) is a metric used in online advertising and marketing to measure the effectiveness of an online campaign for a particular website, advertisement, or link. It is expressed as a percentage and is calculated by dividing the number of clicks on a specific element (such as an ad or link) by the number of times that element was presented (impressions), and then multiplying the result by 100.

The formula for calculating Click-Through Rate (CTR) is:

CTR = Number of Clicks / Number of Impressions * 100

For example, if an ad receives 500 clicks and was displayed 10,000 times, the CTR would be:

CTR = 500 / 10000 * 100 = 5%

A higher CTR generally indicates that a higher percentage of people who saw the ad or link took the desired action, whether it's clicking on the link, visiting a website, or making a purchase. It is an important metric for advertisers and marketers to assess the performance and relevance of their online campaigns.
