# Search Engine Marketing: SEO & SEA

Search Engine Optimization (SEO) and Search Engine Advertising (SEA) are crucial strategies in the field of Search Engine Marketing. They play a significant role in online marketing by helping to drive more traffic to a website and improve its ranking in search engines¹.

## SEO

SEO aims to improve the visibility of a website in organic search results. It includes measures to generate organic traffic and optimize a website's ranking in search results. Well-readable, target group-specific, and informative content can lead to a better placement in search results¹².

## SEA

SEA refers to paid advertisements in the search results of search engines. It is a short-term strategy where companies pay for advertisements to gain immediate visibility. With SEA measures, ROI models for clicks on your website can be created and optimized⁴⁵.

## SEO & SEA: A Dual Strategy

The combination of SEO and SEA offers a comprehensive dual strategy that covers both short-term and long-term goals. SEA delivers immediate results in the form of paid traffic, while SEO works in the background to build and maintain organic traffic⁴.

## Key Factors for a Successful SEA & SEO Strategy

1. **Relevance and quality of the ad**: The ads should be relevant to the users' search queries and provide high-quality information².
2. **Relevance of the landing page**: The landing page should be relevant to the ad and the users' search queries².
3. **Expected click-through rate**: The ads should be designed to achieve a high click-through rate².
4. **Bid price**: The price you bid for the ads can influence the placement of your ads².
5. **Optimization during the campaign**: Since all campaigns are measurable at any time, there is optimization potential already during an ongoing SEA campaign².

By combining SEO and SEA, companies can link quick and long-term online marketing measures and generate higher overall revenues. This allows for a significantly larger reach and simultaneously strengthens brand building⁵.
