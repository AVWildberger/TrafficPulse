"The conversion rate (also known as conversion rate or conversion rate) is a KPI in online marketing. It indicates the ratio of website visitors to conversions. The conversion rate is expressed as a percentage. The conversion does not necessarily have to be a purchase or transaction; any previously defined and achieved goal can count as a conversion. Therefore, the conversion rate can also reflect the ratio of visits to completed downloads or newsletter sign-ups. For Conversion Rate Optimization (CRO), measuring customers in relation to completed conversions is one of the key metrics. CRO is often part of SEO (search engine optimization) and can improve lead generation, revenue, and sales figures.

Definition of Conversion Rate:

The conversion rate represents the ratio of visits/clicks to achieved conversions, where conversions are the transformation of prospects into customers or buyers, such as through purchases or downloads.

Calculation of the Conversion Rate:

In general, the conversion rate is calculated by dividing the number of conversions by the number of impressions, for example:

100 Conversions / 1000 Impressions = 10% Conversion Rate

However, this method can be inaccurate, as automated impressions by bots and repeated page views by the same user may be included. For a more accurate calculation, it is recommended to work with unique visitors or sessions and use cookies for precise counting.

Optimizing the Conversion Rate:

The general assumption among online marketing experts in e-commerce is an average conversion rate of 1%, while successful online shops often reach nearly 10%. The conversion rate depends on factors such as the type of product, prices, and season. For example, a shop selling inexpensive electronics may have a higher conversion rate than a shop selling expensive sports bicycles.

Factors that can affect the Conversion Rate:

Too few payment options, complicated registration processes, inappropriate SEA (search engine advertising) measures, an insecure-looking ordering process, technical issues, poorly placed buttons, and other factors can negatively impact the conversion rate.

Mobile User Experience and Conversion Rate:

With increasing access via mobile devices, a non-mobile-friendly shop faces a deterioration of its conversion rates. The mobile conversion rate of Adwords in 2018 averaged 3.48% in the Google Search Network and 0.72% in the Display Network. Mobile leads primarily come from smartphone access, while the leads-to-customer conversion rate is higher on tablets.

Other important metrics:

The conversion rate should not be considered in isolation. Revenue and profit figures, as well as other metrics such as ROI (return on investment) and the cash conversion rate, play a crucial role in measuring success in businesses."
